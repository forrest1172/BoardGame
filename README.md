Tales of arabian nights like game
 Unity2d tile based board game.
 This project features my own simple 2D A* pathfinding algorithm written in C# using Unity's built-in Tilemap system, basic networking behaviour(able to connect to client and host, display "player" sprites, and update their positions), as well as a custom made procedurally generated tilemap, as the game "world", using perlin noise to make a heightmap from the values of the x,y coordinates.

Tales of Arabian nights consists of 2001 short stories,
 I hope by using procedural narrative story telling to achieve the 
same effect as pre-made stories that are also relevant to the current game state.
